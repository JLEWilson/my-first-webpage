  <h1>Tuxedo's favorite toys</h1>
  <p>While a lot of cats play with all kinds of toys, if they were designed for cats tuxedo will promptly ignore them.

  <ul>
    <li>Straws</li>
    <li>Pencils</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Shoe laces</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tuxedo's favorite activities</h2>
  <p>When tuxedo was younger exploring the neighborhoood and keeping stray cats away from the house were his favorite activities,
    as he got older however he developed a taste for some of the <em>finer</em> things in life!
  </p>
  
  <p>Tuxedoes favorite activities grew to include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Sleeping on chests</li>
    <li>Snuggling in between people on the couch</li>
    <li>Meowing 30 minutes before feeding time</li>
    <li>And being carried high up in the air so he can see what people see</li>
  </ul>
