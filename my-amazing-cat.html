    <li>String</li>
    <li>Shoe laces</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tuxedo's favorite activities</h2>
  <p>When tuxedo was younger exploring the neighborhoood and keeping stray cats away from the house were his favorite activities,
    as he got older however he developed a taste for some of the <em>finer</em> things in life!
  </p>
  
  <p>Tuxedoes favorite activities grew to include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Sleeping on chests</li>
    <li>Snuggling in between people on the couch</li>
    <li>Meowing 30 minutes before feeding time</li>
    <li>And being carried high up in the air so he can see what people see</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks for reading about my amazing cat! May he rest in peace.</p>
